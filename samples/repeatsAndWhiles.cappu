//Examples of while Loops and repeat untils

let i = 0;

//While Loops are structured much like any other programming language
while i <= 10 do
    print(i)
    i++
end

//But repeat untils have their lua syntax in tact
//We start with a repeat and the statement we want to repeat
repeat
    //We do our stuff here
    print(i)

//Then we declare our until here.
until i > 20
